## Status

> A decision may be "proposed" if it hasn't been agreed upon yet, or "accepted"
> once it is agreed upon. Once the ADR has been implemented mark the ADR as
> "implemented". If a later ADR changes or reverses a decision, it may be marked
> as "deprecated" or "superseded" with a reference to its replacement.

## Abstract

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the ADR.
> A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

## Context

> This section contains all the context one needs to understand the current state,
> and why there is a problem. It should be as succinct as possible and introduce
> the high level idea behind the solution.

## Decision

> This section records the decision that was made.
> It is best to record as much info as possible from the discussion that happened.
> This aids in not having to go back to the Pull Request to get the needed information.

## Detailed Design

> This section does not need to be filled in at the start of the ADR, but must
> be completed prior to the merging of the implementation.
>
> Here are some common questions that get answered as part of the detailed design:
>
> - What are the user requirements?
>
> - What systems will be affected?
>
> - What new data structures are needed, what data structures will be changed?
>
> - What new APIs will be needed, what APIs will be changed?
>
> - What are the efficiency considerations (time/space)?
>
> - What are the expected access patterns (load/throughput)?
>
> - Are there any logging, monitoring or observability needs?
>
> - Are there any security considerations?
>
> - Are there any privacy considerations?
>
> - How will the changes be tested?
>
> - If the change is large, how will the changes be broken up for ease of review?
>
> - Will these changes require a breaking (major) release?
>
> - Does this change require coordination with the SDK or other?

## Alternative Approaches

> This section contains information around alternative options that are considered
> before making a decision. It should contain a explanation on why the alternative
> approach(es) were not chosen.

## Consequences

> This section describes the consequences, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be summarized here, not just the "positive" ones.

### Backwards Compatibility

> All ADRs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The ADR must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. ADR submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

### Positive

### Negative

### Neutral

## Further Discussions

> While an ADR is in the DRAFT or PROPOSED stage, this section should contain a summary of issues to be solved in future iterations (usually referencing comments from a pull-request discussion).
> Later, this section can optionally list ideas or improvements the author or reviewers found during the analysis of this ADR.

## Test Cases [optional]

> Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for ADRs that are affecting consensus changes. Other ADRs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## References

> Are there any relevant PR comments, issues that led up to this, or articles
> referenced for why we made the given design choice? If so link them here!
