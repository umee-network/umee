# meToken Module

## Abstract

meToken is a new Token that represents an Index composed of assets used for swaps and redemptions. It can be minted
during the swap of the Index accepted assets and burned to redeem any Index accepted asset. Each Index will have a
unique name for the Token that represents it.

This document specifies the `x/metoken` module of the Umee chain.

The `metoken` module allows users to swap and redeem accepted assets for an Index meToken. The Index meToken will
maintain the parity between underlying assets given a specific configuration.

The `metoken` module depends directly on `x/leverage` for supplying and withdrawing assets, `x/oracle` for assets
prices and the cosmos `x/bank` module for balance updates (coins).

## Concepts

### Accepted Assets

At the foundation of the `metoken` module is the _Index Registry_, which contains a list of Indexes with their meTokens, accepted assets and other parameters.

This list is controlled by the chain governance. Assets that are not in the index registry are not available for swapping or redeeming for the Index meToken.

Once an asset is added to an Index, it cannot be removed. However, its `target_allocation` can be changed to incentivize or disincentivize its presence in the Index.

### Index Parameters

The Index will have the following parameters:

- meToken denom: a denom of the meToken Index that will be given to user in exchange for accepted assets.
- meToken max supply: the maximum amount of meTokens (in specific Index) that can be minted. A swap that requires to
  mint more meToken than this value will result in an error. Every meToken will always have a value of 1 USD.
- Fees: every fee is calculated in USD, but charged to the user in the asset that is used in the operation.
  The calculation will be explained below, the following values will be used as parameters for that calculation:
    - Min fee: the minimum fee to be charged to the user. The applied fee will tend to decrease down to this value,
      when the accepted asset is undersupplied in the index. It must be less than Balanced and Max fees. Valid values
      `[0-âˆž]`.
    - Balanced fee: the fee to be charged to the user when the index is balanced. It must be greater than Min fee and
      lower than Max fee, it cannot be 0.
    - Max fee: the maximum fee to be charged to the user. The applied fee will tend to increase up to this value,
      when the accepted asset is oversupplied in the index. It must be greater than Min and Balanced fee. If the value
      is 0, no Max fee will be applied.
- Accepted Assets: a list where each asset will have the following parameters:
    - Asset denom.
    - Reserve portion: the portion of swapped assets that will be transferred to `metoken` module as reserves, and the
      minimum portion that will be taken from `metoken` module reserves when a redemption occurs. Valid values: `[0-1)`.
    - Target allocation: the portion of an accepted asset the Index is targeting to have. The sum of
      `target_allocation` of every accepted asset in the Index should be equal to 1. Valid values: `[0-1)`.

### Swapping and Redeeming

Users have the following actions available to them:

- Swap accepted asset for Index meToken. Every accepted asset can be swapped for the Index meToken. The exchange
  rate will be determined using prices from `x/oracle` module for the accepted assets and the Index meToken will
  always have 1 USD price for 1 meToken. The user will need to pay a [Dynamic Fee](#dynamic-fee) for the swap. The fee
  will be charged in the accepted asset the Index meToken is offered for.

  Index meToken amount needed for the swap will be minted and transferred to the user's account, while the accepted
  asset for the swap will be transferred to the `leverage` module pools and the `metoken` module reserves.
  The portion to be transferred to each one is determined by the _Index Registry_ configuration of each accepted asset.

  In case the defined portion to transfer to the `x/leverage` is not possible because of the `leverage` module max
  supply cap for a particular token, the remaining part will be transferred to `x/metoken` reserves.

- Redeem Index meToken for accepted asset. Index meToken can be redeemed for every accepted asset. The exchange
  rate will be determined using prices from `x/oracle` module for the accepted assets and the Index meToken will
  always have 1 USD price for 1 meToken. The user will need to pay a [Dynamic Fee](#dynamic-fee) for the redemption.
  The fee will be charged in the accepted asset the Index meToken is redeemed for.

  Index meToken amount needed for the redemption will be withdrawn from the user's account and burned, while
  the chosen asset to redeem will be transferred from the `leverage` module pools and the `metoken` module reserves
  to the user's account. The portion to be withdrawn from each one is determined by the _Index Registry_
  configuration of each accepted asset.

  When it is not possible to withdraw the needed portion from the `leverage` module given its own constraints, the part
  taken from the reserves will increase in order to complete the redemption, if possible.

### Derived Values

Some important quantities that govern the behavior of the `metoken` module are derived from a combination of
parameters. The math and reasoning behind these values are presented below.

As a reminder, the following values are always available as a basis for calculations:

- Account Token balances, available through the `bank` module.
- Index parameters from the _Index Registry_.
- Total reserves of any tokens, saved in `metoken` module reserve balance.
- Total amount of any tokens transferred to the `leverage` module, stored in `metoken` module [State](#state).

The more complex derived values must use the values above as basis.

#### Dynamic Fee

The fee to be applied for the swap or the redemption will be dynamic and based on the deviation from the
`target_allocation` of an asset and its current allocation in the Index. The fee will be transferred to the
`metoken` fee receiver address and its usage will be determined in the future. The formula for calculating the dynamic
fee is as follows:

``` text
dynamic_fee = balanced_fee + [allocation_delta * (balanced_fee / 100)]

If the dynamic_fee is lower than min_fee   -> dynamic_fee = min_fee
If the dynamic_fee is greater than max_fee -> dynamic_fee = max_fee
```

Example for the meUSD index, and the following fee and accepted assets:

``` yaml
- Fee:
  - Min: 0.001
  - Balanced: 0.2
  - Max: 0.5

- USDT:
  - target_allocation: 0.33333
- USDC: 
  - target_allocation: 0.33333
- IST: 
  - target_allocation: 0.33333

After several swaps the index has 1200 USDT, 760 USDC and 3000 IST. Total supply: 4960. 

Calculations for swap:
- USDT deviation from targeted allocation: (0.24193 - 0.33333)/0.33333 = -0.2742027
- USDC deviation from targeted allocation: (0.15322 - 0.33333)/0.33333 = -0.5403354
- IST  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.60483 - 0.33333)/0.33333 =  0.8145081

- USDT swap fee: 0.2 - 0.2742027*0.2 = 0.14515
- USDC swap fee: 0.2 - 0.5403354*0.2 = 0.09193
- IST  swap fee: 0.2 + 0.8145081*0.2 = 0.36290

Calculations for redemption:
- USDT deviation from targeted allocation: (0.33333 - 0.24193)/0.33333 =  0.2742027
- USDC deviation from targeted allocation: (0.33333 - 0.15322)/0.33333 =  0.5403354
- IST  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.33333 - 0.60483)/0.33333 = -0.8145081

- USDT swap fee: 0.2 + 0.2742027*0.2 = 0.25484
- USDC swap fee: 0.2 + 0.5403354*0.2 = 0.30806
- IST  swap fee: 0.2 - 0.8145081*0.2 = 0.03709
```

Another example with an edge case where the min and max fee are used:
``` yaml
- Fee:
  - Min: 0.01
  - Balanced: 0.3
  - Max: 0.8

- USDT:
  - target_allocation: 0.25
- USDC: 
  - target_allocation: 0.25
- IST: 
  - target_allocation: 0.25
- MSK: 
  - target_allocation: 0.25

After several swaps the index has 3500 USDT, 100 USDC, 300 IST and 0 MKS. Total supply: 3900. 

Calculations for swap:
- USDT deviation from targeted allocation: (0.89743 - 0.25)/0.25 =  2.58972
- USDC deviation from targeted allocation: (0.02564 - 0.25)/0.25 = -0.89744
- IST  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.07692 - 0.25)/0.25 = -0.69232
- MKS  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.0 - 0.25)/0.25     = -1.0

- USDT swap fee: 0.3 + 2.58972*0.3 = 1.07691 -> This exceedes the max fee (0.8). In this case the max fee will be used.
- USDC swap fee: 0.3 - 0.89744*0.3 = 0.03076
- IST  swap fee: 0.3 - 0.69232*0.3 = 0.09230
- MKS  swap fee: 0.3 - 1.0*0.3     = 0       -> This is below the min fee (0.01). For this swap the min fee will be applied.

Calculations for redemption:
- USDT deviation from targeted allocation: (0.25 - 0.89743)/0.25 = -2.58972
- USDC deviation from targeted allocation: (0.25 - 0.02564)/0.25 =  0.8974358
- IST  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.25 - 0.07692)/0.25 =  0.69232
- MKS  deviation from targeted allocation: (0.25 - 0.0)/0.25     =  1.0

- USDT swap fee: 0.3 - 2.58972*0.3 = -0.47691 -> This is below the min fee (0.01) and also the fee can't be negative. For this swap the min fee will be applied.
- USDC swap fee: 0.3 + 0.89744*0.3 = 0.56923
- IST  swap fee: 0.3 + 0.69232(0.3 = 0.50769
- MKS  swap fee: 0.3 + 1.0*0.3     = 0.6      -> In this case the redeption is not possible since there is no MKS liquidity anyway.
```

### Reserves

The `metoken` module will have its own reserves to stabilize the processing of the withdrawals. A portion of
every swap will be transferred to the reserves and a percentage of every withdrawal will be taken from the reserves.
This portion is determined by the parameters of every asset in the Index.

#### Reserves Re-balancing

The reserves will be re-balanced twice a day. The frequency will be controlled by updates of the `rebalancing_block`.
The workflow for every asset of each Index is as follows:

- Get the amount of Token transferred to the `leverage` module, stored in `metoken` module [State](#state).
- Get the amount of Token maintained in the `metoken` module reserves.
- Check if the portion of reserves is bellow the desired and transfer the missing amount from `leverage` module to
  `metoken` reserves.
- Update `rebalancing_block`, stored in the `metoken` module [State](#state).

## State

The `x/metoken` module keeps the following objects in state:

- Index Registry: `0x01 | index_name -> Index`
- Transferred to `leverage` module Amount: `0x02 | denom -> sdkmath.Int`
- Next Block for Reserves Re-balancing: `0x03 -> sdkmath.Int`
- Total Token Supply: `0x04 | denom -> sdk.Int`

The following serialization methods are used unless otherwise stated:

- `sdk.Dec.Marshal()` and `sdk.Int.Marshal()` for numeric types
