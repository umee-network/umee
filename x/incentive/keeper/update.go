// updateAccount finishes any unbondings associated with an account which have ended and claims any pending rewards.

// REQUIREMENT: This function must be called during any message or hook which creates an unbonding or updates
// bonded amounts. Leverage hooks which decrease borrower collateral must also call this before acting.
// This ensures that between any two consecutive claims by a single account, bonded amounts were constant
// on that account for each bond tier and collateral uToken denom.
