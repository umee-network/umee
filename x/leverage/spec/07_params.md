| CompleteLiquidationThreshold | sdk.Dec | 0.1     |

## InterestEpoch

InterestEpoch is the number of blocks that pass between interest accruals and
other periodic functions.

## CompleteLiquidationThreshold

CompleteLiquidationThreshold governs how far above their borrow limit a borrower
must be to have a [Close Factor](01_concepts.md#Close-Factor) of 1.0 - that is,
to be eligible for full liquidation in a single liquidation event.

## MinimumCloseFactor

MinimumCloseFactor is the [Close Factor](01_concepts.md#Close-Factor) for
borrows that are just above their borrow limit.
