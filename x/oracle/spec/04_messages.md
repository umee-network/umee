## MsgDelegateFeedConsent

Validators may also elect to delegate voting rights to another key to prevent the block signing key from being kept online. To do so, they must submit a `MsgDelegateFeedConsent`, delegating their oracle voting rights to a `Delegate` that sign `MsgExchangeRatePrevote` and `MsgExchangeRateVote` on behalf of the validator.

> Delegate validators will likely require you to deposit some funds (in Umee) which they can use to pay fees, sent in a separate MsgSend. This agreement is made off-chain and not enforced by the Umee protocol.

The `Operator` field contains the operator address of the validator (prefixed `umeevaloper-`). The `Delegate` field is the account address (prefixed `umee-`) of the delegate account that will be submitting exchange rate related votes and prevotes on behalf of the `Operator`.

```go
// MsgDelegateFeedConsent - struct for delegating oracle voting rights to another address.
type MsgDelegateFeedConsent struct {
	Operator	sdk.ValAddress
	Delegate	sdk.AccAddress
}
```

## MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote

`Hash` is a hex string generated by the leading 20 bytes of the SHA256 hash (hex string) of a string of the format `{salt}:{exchange rate}{denom},...,{exchange rate}{denom}:{voter}`, the metadata of the actual `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote` to follow in the next `VotePeriod`.
You can use the `GetAggregateVoteHash()` function to help encode this hash. Note that since in the subsequent `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote`, the salt will have to be revealed, the salt used must be regenerated for each prevote submission.

```go
// MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote - struct for aggregate prevoting on the ExchangeRateVote.
// The purpose of aggregate prevote is to hide vote exchange rates with a hash
// which is formatted as hex string in SHA256("{salt}:{exchange rate}{denom},...,{exchange rate}{denom}:{voter}")
type MsgAggregateExchangeRatePrevote struct {
	Hash		AggregateVoteHash
	Feeder		sdk.AccAddress
	Validator	sdk.ValAddress
}
```

## MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote

The `MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote` contains the actual exchange rates vote. The `Salt` parameter must match the salt used to create the prevote, otherwise the voter cannot be rewarded.

```go
// MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote - struct for voting on the exchange rates of various assets.
type MsgAggregateExchangeRateVote struct {
	Salt			string
	ExchangeRates	string
	Feeder			sdk.AccAddress
	Validator		sdk.ValAddress
}
```
