          calculations such as collateral value and borrow limit. Can still be

          or withdrawn, but not liquidated. A blacklisted token must have

          Borrowing, collateralizing, or withdrawing assets is not allowed when
          the

          result of such action invalidates min_collateral_liquidity.

          Liquidity can only drop below this value due to interest or
          liquidations.

          The goal is to assure that there is enough available (not borrowed)
          token to be available

          for withdraw when there is a collateral liquidation and the liquidator
          needs to

          the oracle module when evaluating new borrow positions containing this
          token.

          All MsgBorrow, MsgWithdraw, and MsgDecollateralize must result in
          healthy

          borrow positions under both current and historic prices. The default
          value of

          zero for this field causes current price to be used in those
          calculations

          for the affected Token.

          The time span covered by the historic median will be:

      its original end time or its new one based on the new parameter.
