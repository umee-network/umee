> A Golang implementation of the Umee network, a decentralized universal capital
facility in the Cosmos ecosystem.

Umee is a Universal Capital Facility that can collateralize assets on one blockchain
towards borrowing assets on another blockchain. The platform specializes in
allowing staked assets from PoS blockchains to be used as collateral for borrowing
across blockchains. The platform uses a combination of algorithmically determined
interest rates based on market driven conditions. As a cross chain DeFi protocol,
Umee will allow a multitude of decentralized debt products.

## Dependencies

- [Go 1.16+](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Cosmos SDK v0.42.0+](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases)
- [Starport](https://docs.starport.network/intro/install.html)

## Active Networks

Coming soon...

## Build

To install the `umeed` binary:

```shell
$ make install
```

To run the linter:

```shell
$ make lint
```

## Local Network

You can launch a local network for development and testing purposes via two
mechanisms:

1. Docker

   ```shell
   $ make clean localnet-start
   ```

   Running the `localnet-start` target will launch a basic four validator network
   with the umeed binary and artifacts residing in the `./build` directory. A local
   build of the `umeed` binary can be used to interact with the network by using a
   home directory of any of the four validator nodes, e.g. `--home ./build/node0/umeed`.

2. Starport

   ```shell
   $ starport serve
   ```

   Using the `starport` framework, a configurable local network can be created
   with exposed RPC and API endpoints, in addition to a faucet.
