# Release Notes

Release Procedure is defined in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-procedure) document.

## v5.1.0

Highlights:

- [`x/incentive`](x/incentive/README.md) module: allows to create incentive programs for liquidity mining.
- new x/leverage security measure: [Borrow Factor](x/leverage/README.md#borrow-factor)
- new x/leverage [`MsgLeveragedLiquidate`](proto/umee/leverage/v1/tx.proto#L59) was added. Allows suppliers to use their active collateral to absorb unhealthy debts. See [Liquidation](x/leverage/README.md#liquidation) for more details.

[v5.1.0-rc1 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/umee-network/umee/blob/v5.1.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md).

### Validators

#### Peggo

You can kill Peggo.

#### Min Gas Prices

Since v4.2 release we request all validators set a `minimum-gas-prices` setting (in app `config/app.toml` file, general settings). We recommend `0.1uumee` which is equal the current Keplr _average_ setting:

```
minimum-gas-prices = "0.1uumee"
```
