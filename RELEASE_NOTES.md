# Release Notes

Release Procedure is defined in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-procedure) document.

## v5.0.0

Highlights:

- Updated to the latest Cosmos SDK v0.46.12

See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/umee-network/umee/blob/v5.0.0-rc1/CHANGELOG.md)

#### Min Gas Prices

Since v4.2 release we request all validators set a `minimum-gas-prices` setting (in app `config/app.toml` file, general settings). We recommend `0.1uumee` which is equal the current Keplr _average_ setting:

```
minimum-gas-prices = "0.1uumee"
```

You MUST also set the related parameter when starting Peggo `--cosmos-gas-prices="0.1uumee"`
