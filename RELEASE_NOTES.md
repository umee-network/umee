# Release Notes

## v1.1.0

⚠️ This is API compatible, but state-breaking release.

Due to Ethereum PoS migration and potential, messy PoW fork we disable all bridge transfers
(in both directions).
Details and potential way forward are discussed in [`Gravity-Bridge/v1.4.1-umee-2`](https://github.com/umee-network/Gravity-Bridge/module/v1.4.1-umee-2/module/RELEASE_NOTES.md?plain=1#L3)

- updated CI and tooling to go1.19

## v1.0.4

Updates Gravity-Bridge to the latest patch release.
