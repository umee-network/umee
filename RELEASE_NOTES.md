[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

### meTokens

_meTokens_ is an abbreviation for Multi-Variant Elastic Tokens. We describe them as a general-purpose packaged asset builder. Simply put, they are tools to index multiple assets, which allows holders to build composable indexes that spread the risk associated with each asset bundled in an index.

MeTokens offer a way to build DeFi alternatives to TradFi and Web2 financial products. Think of a better, more liquid version of ETFs or mortgage-backed securities. The scope of buildable products will vary from builder to builder as the protocol allows for the creation of some of the most diverse use cases in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

### Validators

Following recent [asa-2023-002](https://forum.cosmos.network/t/amulet-security-advisory-for-cometbft-asa-2023-002/11604) security advisory we decreased the max block size to 4 MB.
Based on Notional [analysis](https://github.com/notional-labs/placid#reduce-the-size-of-your-chains-mempool-in-bytes), mempool size should be adjusted as well. We recommend to set it to `15 * 4 MB` (15 x block size):

```toml
max_txs_bytes = 60000000
```
