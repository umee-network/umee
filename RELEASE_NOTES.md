[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

### Emergency Groups

Currently, any parameter update requires going through a standard governance process, which takes 4 days. In a critical situation we need to act immediately:

- Control IBC Quota parameters (eg disable IBC)
- apply safe updates to oracle, leverage or incentive module parameters.

Emergency Group can trigger safe parameter updates at any time as a standard transaction. The Emergency Group address is controlled by the Umee Chain governance (`x/gov`) and can be disabled at any time.
