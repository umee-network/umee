# Release Notes

Release Procedure is defined in the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#release-procedure) document.

## v6.2.0

Highlights:

- Umee chain upgrades to the latest stable Cosmos SDK v0.47
- The `gov` module in in Cosmos SDK v0.47 has been updated to support a minimum proposal deposit at submission time. It is determined by a new parameter called `MinInitialDepositRatio`. When multiplied by the existing `MinDeposit` parameter, it produces the necessary proportion of coins needed at the proposal submission time. The motivation for this change is to prevent proposal spamming.
  We set `MinInitialDepositRatio` to 10%.`
